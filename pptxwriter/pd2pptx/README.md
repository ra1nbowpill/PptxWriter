# PandasToPowerpoint
Python utility to take a Pandas DataFrame and create a Powerpoint table

An example:

```python
from PandasToPowerpoint import df_to_powerpoint

import pandas as pd

df = pd.DataFrame({'District':['Hampshire', 'Dorset', 'Wiltshire', 'Worcestershire'],
				   'Population':[25000, 500000, 735298, 12653],
				   'Ratio':[1.56, 7.34, 3.67, 8.23]})

df_to_powerpoint(r"C:\Code\Powerpoint\test58.pptx", df,
				  col_formatters=['', ',', '.2'], rounding=['', 3, ''])
```

## Documentation

### df_to_table
Converts a Pandas DataFrame to a PowerPoint table on the given
Slide of a PowerPoint presentation.

The table is a standard Powerpoint table, and can easily be modified with the Powerpoint tools,
for example: resizing columns, changing formatting etc.

Arguments:
 - `slide`: slide object from the python-pptx library containing the slide on which you want the table to appear
 - `df`: Pandas DataFrame with the data
 
Optional arguments:
 - `left`: Position of the left-side of the table, either as an integer in cm, or as an instance of a
   `pptx.util` Length class (`pptx.util.Inches` for example). Defaults to 4cm.
 - `top`: Position of the top of the table, takes parameters as above.
 - `width`: Width of the table, takes parameters as above.
 - `height`: Height of the table, takes parameters as above.
 - `col_formatters`: A `n_columns` element long list containing format specifications for each column.
 For example `['', ',', '.2']` does no special formatting for the first column, uses commas as thousands separators
 in the second column, and formats the third column as a float with 2 decimal places.
 - `rounding`: A n_columns element long list containing a number for each integer column that requires rounding
 that is then multiplied by -1 and passed to `round()`. The practical upshot of this is that you can give something like
 `['', 3, '']`, which does nothing for the 1st and 3rd columns (as they aren't integer values), but for the 2nd column, rounds away the 3 right-hand digits (eg. taking 25437 to 25000).
 - `name`: A name to be given to the table in the Powerpoint file. This is not displayed, but can help
 extract the table later to make further changes.

 Returns:

 The python-pptx table object that was created (which can then be used to do further manipulation if desired)

### df_to_powerpoint
Converts a Pandas DataFrame to a table in a new, blank PowerPoint presentation.
    
Creates a new PowerPoint presentation with the given filename, with a single slide
containing a single table with the Pandas DataFrame data in it.

The table is a standard Powerpoint table, and can easily be modified with the Powerpoint tools,
for example: resizing columns, changing formatting etc.

Arguments:
 - `filename`: Filename to save the PowerPoint presentation as
 - `df`: Pandas DataFrame with the data

All other arguments that can be taken by `df_to_table()` (such as `left`, `width`, `col_formatters` or `rounding`) can also
be passed here.

Returns:

The python-pptx table object that was created (which can then be used to do further manipulation if desired)
